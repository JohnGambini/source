gnaTreeItem.setData() -----
If you add data to a gnaTreeItem that has children it will
insert a column into each of it's children as well. This
means the data set in the children will be displaced ( moved over) if
your adding to column 0 in the parent. (I.E. add the first column to the
parent, the data in the child item gets moved over by one position.)
I think the best way to fix it is to have the parent check for the
existence of column 0 in the children and if it exists, leave it alone.


gnaVariant ------

gnaVariant var = 0 Doesn't work. You can set it to 1,2,3,... or set it
equal to an integer variable but setting it to zero doesn't work.
